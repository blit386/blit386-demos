# blit386-demos

Interactive demos and examples for BLIT386, a palette-first WebGPU retro engine for TypeScript. Deployed to
demos.blit386.dev via Cloudflare Pages. The engine is consumed as `workspace:*`; CI clones both repos to rebuild that
layout (`docs/CI-WORKSPACE-SETUP.md`).

## Critical Rules

- No emoji – code, commits, docs, or UI strings, no exceptions
- Integer coordinates – all rendering uses `Vector2i` and `Rect2i`
- Plain JavaScript – ES2022, never TypeScript, even for a "small" helper
- Beginner-friendly comments – see Documentation Style below. This is the point of the repo, not a nicety
- American English spelling – `color`, `center`, `canceled`, `traveling`, `gray`. Exempt: spec-mandated names correctly
  spelled with a British `s`/`c` in their own spec, such as Web Audio's `AnalyserNode`
- Mutation is fine here – demo classes mutate instance state in `update()` / `render()` for performance. The general
  prefer-immutability default does not apply to per-frame demo state
- Relaxed linting versus the library: JSDoc is not required (though class-level `@implements {IBTDemo}` is encouraged)
  and console logging is allowed. Clarity beats ceremony

## Layout

One demo per file under `src/`, and that file is the single source of truth – no `demos/` directory exists on disk. The
`virtual-demos` Vite plugin serves each at `/demos/<slug>.html` in dev; the production build flattens them to
`https://demos.blit386.dev/<slug>`. `src/shared/` holds the UI kit and cross-demo helpers, `public/` static assets,
`_partials/` the shared HTML template and shell scripts, `plugins/` the Vite plugin plus the order and vintage-URL
registries, `scripts/` the check and generate scripts.

Filenames are number-free kebab-case (`basics.js`, `sprite-effects.js`); the first path segment must start with a
letter, so legacy `001-topic.js` names are rejected. Navigation order is **not** derived from the filename – it comes
from `DEMO_ORDER` in `plugins/demo-order.js`.

## Adding a New Demo

1. Create `src/<topic>.js` with the standard demo class pattern (`configure?`, `init`, `update`, `render`, then
   `bootstrap(Demo)`) and beginner-friendly comments. The `demos-new` skill scaffolds the shape.
2. Append the slug to `DEMO_ORDER` in `plugins/demo-order.js`. Required – otherwise the registry check fails and the
   demo is only soft-appended after the ordered entries.
3. No `vite.config.js` edit, HTML file, or vintage-map entry is needed for a brand-new slug. On a **rename**, update the
   vacated slug's target in `VINTAGE_URLS` (`plugins/demo-vintage-urls.js`) and add a mapping for the old public path so
   bookmarks keep working.
4. Run `pnpm run check:demo-registry` so disk, order, vintage, and nav-hidden sets stay consistent.
5. Add the demo to the `## Demos` list in `README.md` under the right category, using the hosted URL.

The page title defaults to `BLIT386 Demo - Title Cased Topic` (plain hyphen; only the sidebar `navLabel` uses an en
dash). Override with a `// @pageTitle Custom Title` comment in the file header.

## Documentation Style

Demo source is written for readers with little or no coding experience. Comments explain what the code does and why,
never just restating it.

- Comment nearly every line or logical block in plain English
- Explain programming concepts as they appear (what `Math.sin()` returns, what `%` does)
- Use analogies where they help ("like looking through a window" for camera offset)
- Never assume the reader knows what a function does from its name
- Short sentences. No jargon unless you explain it immediately
- Reference earlier demos when a concept was already covered: "We learned about X in the Basics demo:
  <https://demos.blit386.dev/basics>"

Do this:

```js
// Move the square by adding its speed to its position.
// Think of it like adding steps to where you are standing.
this.pos = this.pos.add(this.speed);

// If the square goes past the right edge of the screen...
// BT.displaySize.x is how wide the screen is in pixels.
if (this.pos.x >= BT.displaySize.x - this.size.x) {
  // Flip the horizontal direction so it bounces back.
  this.speed.x = -this.speed.x;
}
```

Not this:

```js
// Update position.
this.pos = this.pos.add(this.speed);

if (this.pos.x >= BT.displaySize.x - this.size.x) {
  this.speed.x = -this.speed.x;
}
```

When reviewing a demo, check that the comments would make sense to someone who has never written code. A block with no
comment, or a comment that only restates the code, is a quality issue.

## Engine API in demos

Current signatures live in the engine: `blit386/src/BLIT386.ts`, `blit386/src/core/BTAPI.ts`, `blit386/src/audio/`.
Match the library's public names exactly – configure flags use grammatical `is*`, runtime input uses `BT.isDown` /
`BT.isPressed` / `BT.isKeyDown`. Prefer the built-ins over re-deriving them: `Color32#luminance` over inline luma
weights, `Color32#multiply` over a hand-rolled tint, `palette.applyHUD(startSlot?)` over six `palette.set()` calls,
`SpriteSheet.loadColorsIntoPalette` before `indexize`.

Two engine behaviors that bite in demos:

**Keyboard edges clear per update tick.** Read `BT.isKeyPressed`, `BT.isKeyReleased`, `BT.inputString`, and the
keyboard-mapped half of `BT.isPressed` / `BT.isReleased` (players 0/1) from `update()`, never `render()`. They clear
once per fixed-update tick, which always runs before that frame's `render()`, so reading an edge from `render()`
intermittently drops presses under rapid input. `BT.isKeyDown` / `BT.isDown` are held state and safe from either.

**Audio unlock is asymmetric.** Browsers refuse sound until a user gesture; `BT.init()` installs one-shot `pointerdown`
/ `keydown` / `touchstart` listeners and `BT.isAudioUnlocked` flips true on the first. Before unlock, `BT.soundPlay()`
is dropped (inert `SoundRef`, no voice) while `BT.musicPlay()` is remembered and starts the instant the context unlocks.
Loading and synthesizing clips work fine while locked. So every audio demo shows a "click or press a key to enable
sound" prompt gated on `BT.isAudioUnlocked` and never assumes a first-frame SFX was heard. There is no
`BT.audioUnlock()` and no `BT.soundLoad()`.

## Shared UI kit

All demo UI – panels, labels, key-value rows, checkboxes, pips, buttons, sliders, meters, the touch D-pad, swipes, tap
zones – comes from the immediate-mode kit in `src/shared/ui.js`. Read that file for the current widget list and options.
Never hand-roll panels, buttons, or HUD text colors in a demo. The one intentional exception is `flurry`, an immersive
screensaver with no demo HUD.

- `applyTheme(this.palette)` in `init()`, before `BT.paletteSet()` – installs the 12 shared UI colors (slots 240-251 by
  default; pass a `startSlot` if that range collides)
- `ui.tick()` as the first line of `update()` whenever the demo uses `{ key }` bindings, gestures, or the D-pad. This is
  what makes keyboard bindings edge-safe – never read `BT.isKeyPressed` in `render()` yourself
- `ui.begin(anchor)` / widgets / `ui.end()` in `render()`. Widget identity is the label; pass `{ id }` for duplicates.
  The kit allocates nothing per frame, so calling it at 60 FPS is fine
- `configure()` runs before `init()`, so overlay styles needing theme colors use literal slot numbers (240 + offset)
  with a comment, or dedicated scene slots
- Every demo must be usable on touch: key-triggered actions get a `ui.button` with a `{ key }` binding, directional
  input gets `ui.dpadWidget()` + `ui.swipe()`, and hardware-showcase demos (`keyboard-input`, `gamepad-input`,
  `keyboard-diagnostic`) show a warm "needs a keyboard/gamepad" label when `ui.hasTouch()` is true
- Post-process demos import `isAvailable()` and `SOFTWARE_FALLBACK_NOTE` from `src/shared/post-process-backend.js`, set
  `this.effectsAvailable = isAvailable()` after `init()` (it checks `BT.activeBackend`, not `requestedBackend`), and
  show the note when effects are skipped

## Hot Reload

`pnpm run dev` / `dev:watch` wire the `blit386/vite` plugin alongside the `virtual-demos` watcher. Editing a demo's own
`src/<slug>.js` no longer full-reloads the page. What happens depends on what you changed:

| Change | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Method body (`render()`, `update()`, …) | Class prototype swapped in place; state kept, `init()` not re-run |
| `init()`, constructor, class field | Instance re-created and `init()` re-run while the old one keeps driving the loop, then swapped on success; `onHotReload(oldSnapshot)` fires if defined |
| `configure()` hardware settings | Full page reload – these are baked into the renderer/audio graph at init |
| Asset in `public/sprites`, `public/audio`, `public/fonts` | Loaded `SpriteSheet` / `AudioClip` / `BitmapFont` replaced in place, no reload |

Still always full-reloads: `_partials/*` edits, a `blit386` dist rebuild (a changed engine bundle invalidates
everything), and adding or removing a `src/<slug>.js` file.

Editing `src/shared/*.js` hot-swaps through Vite's own module graph rather than the engine's swap. That re-evaluates
module-scope state: `ui.js`'s singleton `UiContext` is replaced, and `ui-dpad.js` / `ui-gestures.js` reset their D-pad
and swipe state. So the D-pad can briefly hide, an in-flight swipe or keypress can drop, and `ui.hasTouch()` can revert
to `false` until the next touch – all self-healing within a frame or two. No `addEventListener` runs at module scope in
those files, so a shared-UI edit never double-registers a listener.

Known gap: under `?backend=software`, any `src/<slug>.js` edit currently full-reloads, even a pure `render()`-body
change that hot-swaps cleanly under `webgpu`. That is a tier-detection parity gap in the engine's `src/hot/` runtime,
not in this repo's wiring – tracked against the engine. There is no automated coverage for hot reload; the `demos-test`
skill carries the manual check script to run after touching the wiring.

If you change the engine's `blit386/vite` plugin itself, `dev:watch`'s `build --watch` only rebuilds the browser bundle.
Run a one-shot `pnpm run build` in `blit386` to pick up `dist/vite.js`, then restart `pnpm run dev`.

## File Organization

Section order: header comment (`// Demo Topic – …`, prerequisites, hosted links, optional `// @pageTitle`) → imports →
`@typedef` JSDoc → configuration constants → module state → helper functions → the `Demo` class → `bootstrap(Demo);`
last. Class member order: instance fields → `configure()` → `init()` → `update()` → `render()` → helpers. Region markers
(`// #region`) are banned.

## Commands, formatting, git

Scripts are `pnpm run <script>`; `package.json` is the list and `pnpm run preflight` is the gating set. Shell commands
are rewritten by `rtk hook claude` – prefer `rtk read` / `rtk grep` over native Read/Grep.

Biome owns JS/JSON/CSS, Prettier owns Markdown/YAML: 4-space indent (2 for JSON/YAML/Markdown), 120 columns, single
quotes, semicolons, trailing commas. Markdown tables are compact by design via
`scripts/prettier-plugin-compact-tables.mjs`, a mirror of the canonical copy in `blit386` – never hand-align one.

Conventional Commits with `git commit -s` (this repo's history follows DCO, though only commitlint runs in the hook –
there is no DCO CI check here). Scopes are optional; prefer ones already in history: `demos`, `ui`, `assets`, `docs`,
`skills`, `deps`. AI-assisted commits carry `Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`. Husky runs lint-staged on
pre-commit, commitlint on commit-msg, and `pnpm run preflight` on pre-push.

Deployment is automatic on push to main. The build copies each virtual demo to `dist/<slug>.html` at the site root and
generates `dist/_redirects` from `VINTAGE_URLS` plus a site-index rule, so vintage numbered paths (`/001-basics`) 301 to
the current slug in both environments.

Skills live in `.claude/skills/`, and `.agents/skills/*` are symlinks to them – edit the `.claude` copy once, they are
not two files to patch.
